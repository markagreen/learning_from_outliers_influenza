**Abstract**

*Introduction:* Influenza and influenza-like illness place a heavy burden on UK healthcare, with vaccination programmes shown to be effective but marked by social inequalities in uptake and outcomes. This paper examines why some neighbourhoods show atypical patterns of vaccination and illness beyond what deprivation scores alone can explain.
*Methods:* Electronic health records covering influenza seasons between 2018-19 to 2023-24 were used to explore trends in influenza vaccination and influenza-like-illness (ILI) among adults aged 50 years and above. Multi-level negative binomial regression models were used to examine how vaccination uptake and neighbourhood deprivation were associated with ILI admissions, as well as to identify outlier areas which were further profiled.
*Results:* Most ILI hospital admissions occurred among adults aged 75+, with vaccination uptake highest in this group but declining over time, especially in those aged 50–64. Higher vaccination coverage was generally linked to fewer admissions, although this association weakened after adjusting for neighbourhood deprivation, which itself showed a strong social gradient with more deprived areas experiencing two to three times higher admission rates. Vaccination uptake was consistently lower in more deprived areas, with the steepest declines in uptake seen in younger age groups during 2023–24. Additional neighbourhood factors explained little of the variation beyond deprivation, though communal establishments and older housing showed some influence in specific age groups.
*Conclusions:* Reducing influenza harms will require both boosting vaccination uptake in disadvantaged communities and addressing the wider structural determinants of health.
